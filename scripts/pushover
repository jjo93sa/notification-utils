# Title: pushover
#
# Description:
#   Send messages using the Pushover service, pushover.net.
#
# Dependencies:
#   An account with pushover.net is required to use this script and their
#   service. With your account, you must create two tokens: a User Token and an
#   Application Token. No default values are provided and this script WILL
#   exit if they are not set.
#
# Credits:  None
#
# Usage:
#   You have two options:
#
#   (1) Source this script and either (a) call pushover() with your message as
#   first argument or (b) pipe the message to the pushover function, for example
#
#     echo "my message" | pushover
#
#   (2) Call this script directly with a message as first argument.
@
#   Either way, two environment variables must exist and be non-empty:
#
#     PO_USER_TOKEN - the token used to identify the Pushover user;
#     PO_APP_TOKEN  - the token used to distinguish the application.
#
#   If these are not set, the script exits and no push message is sent.

# Ensure we have the tokens needed for Pushover operation:
: "${PO_USER_TOKEN:?PO_USER_TOKEN env var must be set to use PushOver service}"
: "${PO_APP_TOKEN:?PO_APP_TOKEN env var must be set to use PushOver service}"

# This function takes a message as the firt argument, or from a pipe, and sends
# it via Pushover.
# Parameters:
# -- [$1 - message to send]
function pushover()
{
    # Either msg text supplied by pipe, or as first parameter
    local TEXT=${1:-$(</dev/stdin)}

    # If we still haven't got any text, let's just send the PID
    if [ -z "$TEXT" ]
    then
        TEXT="Message from PID: $$"
    fi

    # Removed 2018-09-20: Pushover prepends date-time stamp so we don't need to
    #local USER_MESSAGE="message=$(date -u "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"): $TEXT"
    local USER_MESSAGE="message=$TEXT"

    local PUSHOVER_RESPONSE=$(curl -s --form-string "token=$PO_APP_TOKEN" \
        --form-string "user=$PO_USER_TOKEN" \
        --form-string "$USER_MESSAGE" \
        https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json)

    CURL_EXIT_STATUS=$?

    echo "Curl exited with $CURL_EXIT_STATUS; Pushover response $PUSHOVER_RESPONSE"
}

# A smart bit of trickery to see if this script is running as exe or as source
if [[ "$0" == "$BASH_SOURCE" ]]; then
    # we haven't been sourced, so run as executable
    pushover "$1"
    exit $?
